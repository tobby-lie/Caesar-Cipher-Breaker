# Caesar Cipher Breaker

Caesar Cipher breaker done in two methods: Brute force and frequency attack. Takes input from user and at each line
asks if the shifted output is the correct result. 

## Description

1. Learn about Caesar Cipher
2. Learn about strategies to do a cryptoanalysis attack on Caesar ciphertext without having the key
3. Write a program in Python that receives an input ciphertext and produces its plaintext. One solution is
  brute-force but the goal is to minimize the number of guesses.

The program must output every guess in a separate line and ask if it looks like the correct output.
